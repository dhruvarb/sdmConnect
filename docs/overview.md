## **User System:**

14. **User Registration**:
    - User can sign up by providing username, email, password, avatar, and cover image.
    - Avatar and cover images are uploaded via Multer middleware.
    - Passwords are hashed using `bcryptjs` before storing in the database.
15. **User Login**:
    - Authenticated using email and password.
    - Returns a JWT token for secure communication with the backend.
16. **User Logout**:
    - Logs the user out by invalidating the session (JWT token).
17. **JWT Authentication**:
    - Users are authenticated using JWT tokens, which are passed in the Authorization header for protected routes.
18. **Profile Management**:
    - Users can update their profile information such as username, email, avatar, and cover image.
19. **Password Management**:
    - Passwords are hashed and securely stored in the database.
    - Users can change their password through the profile management page.
20. **User Dashboard**:
    - Provides access to uploaded resources, ratings, comments, and profile settings.

---

## **Admin System:**

21. **Admin Authentication**:
    - Admin users are authenticated using JWT tokens and a custom middleware.
22. **Admin Privileges**:
    - Admin users have the ability to manage other users and resources, such as blocking or deleting users and resources.
23. **Admin Dashboard**:
    - Provides a statistical overview (number of users, resources, blocked users, etc.).
24. **User Management**:
    - Admin can delete users or block/unblock users from the platform.
25. **Resource Management**:
    - Admin can block or unblock resources based on content violations or other criteria.
26. **Admin Controls for Resources**:
    - Admin can view all uploaded resources and delete them if necessary.
27. **Role-Based Access Control**:
    - Admin has higher-level privileges compared to regular users, ensuring resource and user management can be restricted.

## **Resource Management:**

28. **Resource Upload**:
    - Users can upload educational resources (PDF files) along with metadata such as title, description, branch, semester, etc.
    - File size is limited, and only PDF files are allowed.
29. **Resource Metadata**:
    - Includes fields like `title`, `description`, `semester`, `branch`, `fileSize`, and `url`.
30. **Resource Storage**:
    - Uploaded files are stored in the `uploads/` directory, and the URL of the file is saved in the MongoDB database.
31. **Resource File Name Generation**:
    - File names are generated uniquely to avoid conflicts (e.g., using `UUID` or `timestamp`).
32. **Resource URL**:
    - The file URL is stored in the database, and the resource is publicly accessible via a secure endpoint.
33. **Resource Accessibility**:
    - Authenticated users can view and download resources, but admin users can manage the resources.

## **Resource Rating System:**

34. **Rating a Resource**:
    - Users can rate resources on a scale from 1 to 5.
35. **Average Rating Calculation**:

36. **Rating Restriction**:
    - Users can only rate a resource once.
37. **Remove Rating**:
    - Users can delete their own ratings from resources.
38. **Rating Model**:
    - A separate `Rating` model is used to store user ratings with a reference to the resource and the user who rated it.

---

## **Comment System:**

39. **Add a Comment**:
    - Users can add comments to resources.
40. **Edit a Comment**:
    - Users can edit their comments if needed.

50. **Avatar Upload**:
    - Users can upload an avatar image during registration or profile update.
51. **Cover Image Upload**:
    - Users can upload a cover image during registration or profile update.
52. **Multer File Storage**:
    - Files are saved in a specified directory (`uploads/`) and served through a public URL.
53. **Error Handling**:
    - Proper error messages are provided if file uploads fail (e.g., file type not allowed, file too large).

## **Security Features:**

54. **JWT Authentication**:
    - JWT tokens are used for authenticating users and ensuring that routes are accessible only to authorized users.
55. **Access Control**:
    - Role-based access control is implemented, ensuring only admins can manage users and resources.
